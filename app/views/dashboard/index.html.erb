        <h5 class="subheader">Phantasy Phishbowl is an epic game setlist speculation for Phans of the band Phish. Here are the rules:</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>For each concert, a player predicts songs Phish will play on a given date.</li>
          <li>Players must pick a set one opener and closer, a set two opener and closer, encore, and one random pick.</li>
          <li>Players are awarded three points for getting a pick in the right spot, one point if the song appears anywhere in the setlist, and two points if the random pick is played.</li>
          <li>When Phish is not on tour, players can guess which songs Phish played during a recent show.</li>
        </ol>
